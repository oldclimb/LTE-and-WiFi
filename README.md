# LTE-and-WiFi
convergence of heterogeneous networks,network aggregation

  we plan to realize lte and wifi aggregation at PDCP layer of lte.we have already run the oai code in lte_with_s1 and lte_no_S1 
modes successfully.3GPP proposed LWIP architecture in their specifications recent years.our project is build upon the conception 
of LWIP and our goal is to transmit data using lte and wifi network interface at the same time.
